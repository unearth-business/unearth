UNEARTH
Our app is designed to allow users to search a zip code to find hiking trails near them. 
We also have an advanced search function that will allow users to enter in a search radius, a minimum trail length, and the amount of results that they would like to see. Once the user has the results pulled up they have the option to search the nearby restaurants, busses, trains, and hostels. 

Our motivation for this project was our love for the outdoors and the lack of a consolidated database of hiking trails with descriptions of accessibility and nearby attractions. 

Our app is currently fully functional and pulling in the data regarding the trails and nearby attractions. In the future, we would like the app to display and interactive map that will grab the users current locations and allow them to also get directions to the trail. We would also like for users to have the ability to track the places that they have been and leave reviews on the page for others to see. 

The coding languages used for this app are html, css, and javascript. 
The APIs used are hiking project and a few of Google’s options.

Our design process consisted of the following phases.
1. Planning
 - During this phase we researched the API's that we wanted to use, decided what the premises of our app would be and the functionality of the app and built a wireframe.
2. Design 
- During this phase we chose our images, color scheme and continued to design the layout of our pages. 
3. Development
- Most of the coding was done during this phase. Utilizing javascript we pulled in API data from google and hiking project that allows users to input a zip code in order to search the nearest hiking trails and attractions. 
4. Launch
- During this phase we tested all of our links and functionality of our app and continued to improve the look and feel.
